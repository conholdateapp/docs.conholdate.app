Assemble your own forms and document wizards online made easy with our document assembly engine.

## What is Forms
Forms is a web-based app used to generate documents using a pre-defined templates in a wizard a-like step-by-step form.
Imagine that you have two similar documents with few minor differences, with Forms you can keep only one document as template and generate desired output anytime you want.
The result from filling up the form can be obtained as PDF, DOC and DOCX (more formats coming soon) or emailed to preset email addresses.

## How to create Forms
In order to create your own Form it is required to create two files: **docx** and **xml** with equal names.
For example: `my_form.docx` and `my_form.xml`
> Download our [form](/download?template=example-forms.zip) example for the further reference.

### DOCX template
DOCX template is your main template which holds static data/text along with dynamic data/variables.
1. Open existing or create new DOCX file;
1. Now type any `TAG` (a.k.a. `ID`) where you want to submit dynamic data.
	> `TAG` must be unique in order to work correctly  
	> TAG Example: `<<[myTag]>>`

### XML template
XML template structure is simple and divided by `sections` inside root element `form`. Each `section` represents form/wizard step.
1. Create new XML file;
1. Add root element `<form></form>`;
1. Inside `<form>` add `<step></step>`;
1. Now we can add `<section></section>`. Each `step` can have as many `sections` as you like.
1. Each `<section>` must have:
	- type
	- id
	- title
	- description
	- question
	Where `id` = `tag` name from DOCX file.

See following XML example:
```xml
<form>
	<step>
		<section>
			<type>input</type>
			<id>myTag</id>
			<title>My title</title>
			<question>My question?</question>
			<description>Input description, question, etc</description>
		</section>
		<section>
			<type>textarea</type>
			<id>myAnotherTag</id>
			<title>Another title</title>
			<question>My another question?</question>
			<description>textarea description, question, etc</description>
		</section>
	</step>
	<step>
		<section>
			<type>dropdown</type>
			<id>myDropdownTag</id>
			<title>One more title</title>
			<description>dropdown description, question, etc</description>
			<required>true</required>
			<question>One more question?</question>
			<options>
                <option>
					<title>{option_title}</title>
					<value>{option_value}</value>
				</option>
                <option>
					<title>{option_title}</title>
					<value>{option_value}</value>
				</option>           
            </options>
		</section>
	</step>
</form>
```
This example has 2 steps, where first step has 2 questions with text input and text area and second step has one question with dropdown menu.

### Supported question types
- input (text imput field)
- textarea (text area)
- dropdown (dropdown)
- checkbox (checkbox)
- radio (radio button)
- date (date picker)

### Advanced settings
With advanced option you can specify required or optional questions, allow/disallow downloads and sent resulted documents to provided email addresses.
- To set any question as required just add `<required>true</required>` parameter to `<section></section>` property. Setting to **false** means that question is optional.
	By default it is set as **true** - required.
- Allowing/disallowing downloads and sending resulted documents can be achieved by added `<settings>` property inside root element `<form>`, in the same way as you did for `<section>`.
	Example:
	```xml
		<form>
		...
			<settings>
				<download>
					<enable>true</enable>
					<downloadAs>PDF, DOCX</downloadAs>
				</download>
				<email>
					<enable>true</enable>
					<emailTo>test@email.com, test@secondemail.com</emailTo>
					<emailAs>DOCX</emailAs>
				</email>
			</settings>
		...
		</form>
	```

### Assemble template
Now that you have both DOCX and XML templates it is time to assemble your form.
In order to assemble your final template, just zip both files into single zip.
